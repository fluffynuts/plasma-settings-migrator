# plasma-settings-migrator: build, test and tidy the CLI, for machines without make.

# GO, BINARY and PKG can be overridden from the environment, as with make.
#
# dist packages a release zip in dist/: the binary plus whatever BUNDLE
# (below) lists, under one top-level folder. It builds for GOOS/GOARCH when
# those are set (cross-compiling, with cgo off), else for this machine.
# Linux only: plasma-settings-migrator manages KDE Plasma settings.
# BUILD, when set, is the CI build number: it becomes the version's third
# part, in the name and in the binary (plasma-settings-migrator --version). DIST_LABEL, when
# set, goes into the name too: plasma-settings-migrator-<version>[.<build>][-<label>]-<os>-<arch>.
# The zip is made with zip(1) so the binary keeps its executable bit.
