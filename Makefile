# plasma-settings-migrator: build, test and tidy the CLI.
#
# Nothing in here lists source files or packages, so it keeps working as the
# project grows: sources are found with `find`, and tests, vet and the
# release zips cover whatever `./...` covers. Only PKG, the folder holding
# the program's main package, needs to change if main moves.
#
# make.sh does the same jobs on machines without make.
