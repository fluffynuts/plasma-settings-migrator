// A plain `go build` leaves it as "dev".

// Build is the CI build number a release was made from, appended to Version
// as its third part ("0.1.57"): set the same way as Version, and empty for
// any other build. VERSION is bumped by hand and every push to the release
// branch is released, so this is what tells those releases apart, and keeps
// each release a valid semantic version that sorts after the last.

// leaves it out.

// passing in; it can still be overridden with
// -ldflags "-X github.com/fluffynuts/plasma-settings-migrator/internal/appcli.Commit=..." — which only works on
// a variable with no initialiser, hence init rather than "= vcsCommit()".
